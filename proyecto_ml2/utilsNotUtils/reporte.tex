\section{Introduction}

In its general form, a functional causal model consists of a set of equations ofthe form

\[
x_i = f_i(pa_i, u_i), i = 1, \dots, n,
\]

where $pa_i$ stands for the set of variables that directly determine the value 
of X_i and where  $U_i$ represent errors due to omitted factors.
